# Feature: Indicate PRs that address issues in issues list
When looking at an open issues list or a milestone, it's sometimes helpful to know, at a glance, what the status of an issue is. Some features built into GitHub that let you infer the status are:
- If the issue is assigned
- If the issue has a PR open to address it

In the issues list, the first is handled automatically by GitHub but the second is not: this feature adds these PRs to the issues list.
